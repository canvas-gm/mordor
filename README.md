# mordor
Mordor tower (Central Realtime Socket Server API for CGM).

## Getting Started

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

On the first start the server should generate a `customconfig.json` in the /config directory. Use it to configure the server like you want (and dont touch defaultconfig.json).

## Roadmap

- Work on authentication by sending an email with a token!
- Allow to filter on getProjects socket command.
- Add argon2 hash for password!
